title: To comment, or not to comment

---

When working in professional Java projects or looking through open source projects, we can come across several styles of commenting code and various opinions on how it should be done. Some people like to insert pseudocode-like comments everywhere they can, others claim that commenting should be avoided at all costs as it's a sign of poor design. Let's have a look at what tools does Java give us when it comes to commenting code and then let me share with you my opinion on when and how to use them.

## How to comment

The official Java Comment Conventions can be found [at Oracle's website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-141999.html). The document is quite old, but still valid. If you want to find more details on anything I write about in this section, see that link. This section is basically a summary of that document, all quotes come from there.

Java gives us two kinds of comments: **implementation** and **documentation** comments.

> Implementation comments are meant for commenting out code or for comments about the particular implementation. Doc comments are meant to describe the specification of the code, from an implementation-free perspective, to be read by developers who might not necessarily have the source code at hand.

In other words, **documentation** comments are what we commonly know as **Javadoc**. Let's have a look at what particular types of comments does the official documentation describe.

### Block comments

> Block comments are used to provide descriptions of files, methods, data structures and algorithms. Block comments may be used at the beginning of each file and before each method. They can also be used in other places, such as within methods.

```java
/*
 * This is a block comment
 */
```

### Single-line comments

> Short comments can appear on a single line indented to the level of the code that follows. If a comment can't be written in a single line, it should follow the block comment format

```java
/* This is a single line comment */
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
```

### Trailing comments

> Very short comments can appear on the same line as the code they describe, but should be shifted far enough to separate them from the statements. If more than one short comment appears in a chunk of code, they should all be indented to the same tab setting.

```java
System.out.println("Hello, World!");	/* This is a trailing comment */
```

### End-of-line comments

> The // comment delimiter can comment out a complete line or only a partial line. It shouldn't be used on consecutive multiple lines for text comments; however, it can be used in consecutive multiple lines for commenting out sections of code.

```java
// Print 'foo'
System.out.println("foo");

//if (bar) {
//	System.out.println("bar");
//}

return false;		// Explain why false is returned
```

### Documentation comments

> Doc comments describe Java classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields. Each doc comment is set inside the comment delimiters /\*\*...\*/, with one comment per class, interface, or member.

```java
/**
 * This is a javadoc comment. Notice the double * at the opening, which distinguishes it from a block comment.
 */
```

## When to comment

Comments are probably the easiest part of a programming language's syntax - but knowing **when** to comments is the tricky part.

I usually come across two kinds of people when it comes to commenting code - the **anti-commenters** and the **overcommenters**.

**Anti-commenters** are people who claim that **any** comments are symptom of bad design and will happily flag them in any code review they encounter without giving a second thought on why are they there. I understand where they are coming from but I disagree with the absolute no-comments rule. 

**Overcommenters** are usually young developers with little experience. Overcommenting in such a case stems from the fact that they find it easier to describe the work they need to do in pseudo-code comments first and then fill it with actual code. I believe it's a good practice, it takes the load off one's mind and makes it easier to focus at particular pieces of a whole - but such comments should be removed at the ned and the code needs to explain by itself what it does - through proper class and functions names and other means.

When it comes to commenting I personally look at **two rules**:
* Explain the context - **describe not what a partiular piece of code does, but why does it do what it does**
* **Don't repeat information** - in a piece of code like `List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();` it is obvious what the list is for, there's no need to add `// Create a list to hold names`

The technique I use for deciding whether or not a piece of code should have some comments is very simple - put yourself in the shoes of a person who reads your code. Assume you're a developer that just got assigned to the project, you have no idea about the system as a whole, about all the different modules working on different servers and integrating with each other; about conventions and terminology assumed in the project. Imagine reading your code as such a person and focus on one thing - what **context** would you need to know to understand the code better?

For example, you might have a large listener class that reads events from a `RabbitMQ` Queue and does a lot of business logic on them. Perhaps it would be useful to add a block comment at the top of the class explaining what the queue is for in terms of business logic, in what other microservice is the queue populated with events and what do the events represent (again, in terms of business logic). This information can make it a lot easier to understand your code, because you suddenly know **what is the purpose**, not only what it **technically does**.

```java
/*
 * Events that this listener listens for are generated and inserted into the queue
 * in module X, when the user does this and that on the reviews page.
 *
 * This Listener will process the events and send them to API X or move them to an error queue if processing
 * fails for any reason.
 *
 * There are a few flags in the properties file that control the behaviour of this logic:
 * ...
 * ...
 * ...
 */
public class ReviewListener {
	// ... a lot of business code here
}
```

And there we go. A few short sentences. The reader immediately knows where the events come from, what actual user action do they convey, a broad picture of what the code does and what are the possible outcomes and some additional information he might find useful, like the control flags.
Sure, he could get most of this information from the code itself - but that would require a lot more effort and/or talking to the person responsible for it (if still available). I believe such short summaries of some pieces of business logic code increase readability immensly.

Of course, such a block comment might (and probably will) get outdated after a while. People will make changes to the code and not update the block comment at the top, etc. However, that's the reason why you should not describe **implementation details** but just the **overall context**, which is not **subject to change**. In our example, describing what the events represent is pretty safe - if at some point the architecture shifts from a queue implementation to something else, your listener will probably be removed anyway and your block comment deemed obsolete alongside it.

Comments are also useful when your code does something that might seem weird but is justified either by business requirements or drawbacks in external or internal dependendencies. For example, in one of the projects I've been working on, I had to integrate with an external API that left a lot to wish for. One of the endpoints required me to send a single element in a form of a list with one and only one element - it had something to do with legacy compliance on their side. Writing some code that packs a single element into a list to send it to an API might raise a few eyebrows. That's why I decide to add some comments that explained the **context** - they informed the reader **not what the code does**, because that was obvious, but **why does it do it like that**.

```java
Review review = createReview();
// External API expects to get a list with only a single review in it - others will be ignored.
dto.setReview(Arrays.asList(review));
```

Another case I find a few comments useful is in a long and complicated logic flow. Of course you might say that if the code was properly structured and well thought-through it should still be easy to read and understand, despite its length and complexity. I agree with that, however, I deem it an unobtainable dream - neither the project we work on, nor we, are perfect. People will make errors and create subpar code. Requirements will keep changing, forcing us or others to sacrifice readability and proper design for the sake of pushing out features. That's just how the world is and anyone who claims otherwise was either extremely lucky or has little experience.

Therefore, when I happen to work on a long, complex and far-from-ideal (for various reasons) code flow, I like to do a favor to others and perhaps my future self by leaving a few crucial comments here and there. Again, bearing in mind the rule to **not repeat information that is already there**. To do this, I use the method I described above - I try to think as someone who sees the code for the first time - and then I go through the code and add some additional information that I feel might be useful towards understanding the whole. For example, in our long code flow we might have a `boolean` flag that controls some small piece of it - proper naming of that flag is crucial towards readability, but adding some additional information in a comment might make reading the code even easier.

```java
// (...) a lot of code here
boolean isPreemptivelyProcessed = false;	// 'Preemptively processed' in this case means data from module X has been collected and added to the processed object
// (...) more code
```

When someone is reading your code flow, he might encounter the `isPreemptivelyProcessed` flag and wonder what does it actually mean in the business context. The flag tells us the object had some initial processing applied but we don't know what does it actually mean. The person reading this code will probably look for where the flag is defined and try to figure out what it conveys - he'll then stumble upon the comment that might clear things up just enough for him to progress further, without more digging into this particular flag. Of course, we might just name it `enrichedWithDataFromModuleX` but I don't think that's a good name. It gets even trickier when we got something that conveys a lot more information in it, making naming it properly troublesome. I believe such an explanatory comment is a really good way of increasing readability in difficult circumstances.
